Description: 
In this assignment we'll use test first development to create the program we discussed in homework 1.
Follow test first coding, don't write any code unless a failing test demands it. Write minimum code to make tests pass. Start early and take very small steps. 
Keep your tests passing at all times. Keep the design lightweight and the code quality high.

After the implementation is complete, compare the design created in Assignment 1 with the design you described in Homework 1.

- Test Driven Development helped us to create more modular , expressive and confident design.
- TDD also helped us to create simple design as no code was written without writing a test for it.
- Initially, we did not use any test cases. But after adopting to TDD, we are now confident of our design as we have enough test cases where our design can fail
- Therefore TDD helps us creating simple, effective design with less code.
