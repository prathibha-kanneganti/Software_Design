Description: 
In this assignment we'll use test first development to create the program we discussed in homework 1.
Follow test first coding, don't write any code unless a failing test demands it. Write minimum code to make tests pass. Start early and take very small steps. 
Keep your tests passing at all times. Keep the design lightweight and the code quality high.

After the implementation is complete, compare the design created in Assignment 1 with the design you described in Homework 1.
