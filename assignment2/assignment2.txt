Questions:
- Discuss your experience working in pair.

	It was nice working in pairs beacause the work is being divided between us equally. Also,we are able to make things happen in a less time. Most importantly,we get to know each other thoughts and thus learn from each other mutually. We found working in pair very useful.

- Did your design changed from HW2? Why?

	Yes, the design that we had mentioned in hw2 was changed slightly. The initial design had more number of classes and methods, which when used test driven development in assignment 2 , were reduced significantly. With this change in the design, a better design of code was obtained and was made sure that there were no code smells.
